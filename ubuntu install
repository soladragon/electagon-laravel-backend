Install the project dependencies from composer
composer install

Install NPM dependencies (optional)
npm install

Create a copy of your .env file
cp .env.example .env

Generate your encryption key
php artisan key:generate

Create an empty database for your project
Configure your .env file to allow a connection to the database


Otherwise try these commands that can help:

Set the right permissions on all directories and files in your project by simply running

chmod 755 -R nameofyourproject/
chmod -R o+w nameofyourproject/storage
Clean up your project

php artisan cache:clear
php artisan view:clear
php artisan config:clear
Sometimes you have to add to your /public/ or /index.php/ url

This isn't over, what if you have a database?

Well, let's get on with it.



Migrations in Laravel allow you to have all your DB architecture in your code and with a simple command line you recreate all your tables.

php artisan migrate
This command creates the structure of your database but does not fill any tables.

If the repository has a seed file, this is the time to run it, in order to fill your database with startup or dummy data.

php artisan db:seed
PRO TIP: You can combine the 2 previous commands into one command which is this one:

php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
Migrations are super handy, but if you don't have one you simply import the sql file from your old database with your favorite database tools. This will create all your tables with your contents.
